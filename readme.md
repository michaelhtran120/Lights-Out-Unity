# Lights Out - Unity Game

This was a mini side project that was to see if I could pick up enough Unity and C# to create a Lights Out game per a project brief.

## Retrospective

I definitely made this more complicated than it had to be. Once I got the hang of the Unity interface and how it interacts with the script files, it was much easier to accomplish.

I feel that I can definitely recreate this game from scratch within a few hours or a couple hours knowing what I know now.

Thanks Ben Mosher for giving me this brief. This was challenging and I enjoyed it!
